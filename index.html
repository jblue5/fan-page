    <h2>Why Jog?</h2>
        <p>I enjoy jogging first thing in the morning becuase it offers a challenge right after <br/>
            getting out of bed. In the past I would rely I on energy drinks, shots, or expresso. <br/>
           It wakes me up and there is a peaceful calm when its all done, when done outside early and <br/>
           its just you and nature, there isn't a better being "present" moment when you finish the run.</p>
